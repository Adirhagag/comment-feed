# Comment Feed

This is a Comment Feed app, were users can type in their email and their message and the comment will be added to the feed.
If a user have a Gravatar account he will see his Gravatar photo in the user image area, and if a user doesn't have a Gravatar account he will see a default anonymous image.

## Project core technologies
The project Frontend is using React framework, 
the Backend is using Node.js
and for the database I used MongoDb.
